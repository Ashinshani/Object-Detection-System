# Object-Detection-System
This project demonstrates an object detection application using OpenCV. It can detect and highlight objects in both static images and real-time video streams. The app leverages computer vision techniques to identify objects, draw bounding boxes, and display confidence scores.âœ¨

ðŸš€ Features

âœ…Detect objects from images and live video

âœ…Draw bounding boxes with labels

âœ…Adjustable confidence threshold

âœ…Lightweight and easy to extend for custom datasets
